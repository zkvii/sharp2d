# win2d

## Although I'm not a very proficient C++ developer, many features of Win2D are quite frustrating, so I plan to develop my own. Here is my todo list:

- [ ] add custom font from arbitrary location to fontset
- [ ] add custom font from stream to fontset
- [ ] explosure a more comprehensive textformat interface
- [ ] multithread support for xaml panel
